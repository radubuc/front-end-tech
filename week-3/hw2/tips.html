              <h5>Why Should I Optimize Images?</h5>
              <p>Large, unoptimized images can make your website slow and clunky like nothing else. Your users won't wait around for your website to load, and optimizing your images will go a long way toward ensuring that it loads quickly.</p>

              <p>When your website takes forever to load, it doesn't exactly provide the best experience for your users. Your users expect your site to load quickly. Optimizing your images helps to ensure a better user experience and that you meet users' expectations.</p>

              <p>Image optimization will help to ensure that your images rank in image searches on Google, and it will also be beneficial to the overall SEO (search engine optimization) of your website. Additionally, page speed plays an important part of Google's search algorithm, and image optimization will help you avoid the organic search penalties of having a slow website.</p>

              <h5>How Do I Optimize Images?</h5>
              <p>There are many image compressors online. One you can try is <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG.com</a> and upload files. TinyPNG will automatically optimize your image using smart lossy compression. Then you can download the image to your computer or Dropbox. It's that simple!</p>

				<h5>Why Are Accessible Colors Important?</h5>
				<p>Color accessibility is important because it enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts.</p>

				<p>Apart from accessibility being an ethical best practice, there are also potential legal implications for not complying with regulatory requirements around accessibility. In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least 814 federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions.</p>

				<p>You can also ensure accessibility by making sure you don't rely on color to relay crucial system information. So, for things like error states, success states, or system warnings, be sure to incorporate messaging or iconography that clearly calls out what's going on.</p>

				<h5>How Do I Check If a Color is Accessible?</h5>
				<p>There are many tools online. WebAIM, an organization devoted to making the Internet accessible for all, has a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker" target="_blank">contrast checker tool</a> you can use.</p>

              <h5>Why Can't I See Changes on My Site?</h5>
              <p>Internet browsers normally include the capability of caching pages in order to make your Internet browsing a quicker experience. The problem that occurs is that sometimes you visit a page where a change has occurred, and it does not appear because you're seeing the old cached version that your browser stored. This can be easily fixed by simply clearing the browser cache.</p>

			 <p>If you are looking for a faster way of loading an uncached version of a webpage and are feeling brave, you can try disabling the cache through Dev Tools. Right click on a page and select Inspect. Switch to the Network tab, and check Disable Cache. Reload the page with Dev Tools open and you will see an uncached version of the site.

		  <table class="container table table-light table-hover">
			<tr>
				<th>Question</th>
				<th>Answer</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Can I build emails using only images?</td>
				<td><p>Images allow for more creative layouts and a custom look and feel for emails. Because you aren't restricted to web-safe fonts, everything in the email can stay within brand standards with custom fonts, etc. An added bonus is all-image emails are quick to code, so you're cutting down on the time it takes to get an email out the door.</p>
				<p>The big con is that it's not best practice in the sense that if the images don't load, then neither does the content. If CTAs exist within the image itself, they're also lost. When subscribers have to click to load the images, they often decide based on copy. If you're deploying an all-image email, make sure you're using good quality alt text (the copy that appears before images load). For this reason, it's best to try and keep all CTAs bulletproof, which means they are built strictly out of code.</p>
				<p>Also, copy isn't as crisp when it's an image, especially in mobile versions. To compensate, designers can increase the font size, but it doesn't always look good. As far as development goes, we can't usually make an all-image email responsive unless the design is mobile-first. And you have to consider deliverability—an all-image email will likely go to spam if the brand doesn't have a good inbox reputation.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>How can I make copy in my images more crisp?</td>
				<td><p>You can double the resolution of the image, which makes it “retina,” and set the image at its usual width. So, for example, a 320px image would be 640px, and then you just set 320px as the width of the image to make the text clear. A warning, though: if the image has a lot of elements (say a hero image), then the file size will be much larger, resulting in slower image download speeds for some people.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Should I use only live text for copy?</td>
				<td><p>While many commonly used email clients automatically load images, some do not. When an email utilizes live text, subscribers can see the content as soon as they open the email. It benefits them and your brand. And the copy is clear and crisp. Live text emails are also much better for responsive designs and least likely to go to spam.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, live text emails sometimes limit the look and feel of the design and can result in very templated emails. Plus, live text means we can only use web-safe fonts. Brand fonts can be used but are only supported in Apple-based products. You'll need a backup font if you choose to use a brand font. A good workaround for maintaining a brand's standards regarding font is to use the brand font for headlines and slice as an image while keeping the rest of the copy live text.</p>
